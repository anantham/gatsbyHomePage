## About me

> I can keep talking with you on topics that fascinate me; like science, philosophy and mathematics. I like sweets. A lot. I am open minded to the point of naivety. I have been working (unsuccessfully) on improving my handwriting for the past 8 years. You can message me and will find that I am an open book, ask any question without fear of offending me.

Few of the things that I love to tell people about is the [Research Debt](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/), how awesome the [stackexchange](https://stackexchange.com/users/2408244/aditya) sites are, how we need to talk about meaningful [electoral reform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=EC7679C7ACE93A5638&v=s7tWHJfhiyo), how [3b1b](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEfHFsfGXjs) is just at the God tier!! I am unashamedly a fanboy. 

We have to look beyond using just plain text and images to disseminate knowledge. I think [explorable explanations](http://worrydream.com/ExplorableExplanations/) is the future. Some examples you can check out are [quaternions](https://eater.net/quaternions), [algorithms](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/), and  [Evolution of Trust](https://ncase.me/trust/). Look just go find a topic you like [here](https://explorabl.es/) and please spread the word!
