<ProjectCard title="Binary Classifier" link="https://anantham.github.io/Stats202/" bg="linear-gradient(to right, #D4145A 0%, #FBB03B 100%)">
This project done in R, is part of my Stats202 class which I took when I went to Stanford university in the Summer of 2016. The objective was to determine if a query was relevant (yes/no) to a webpage given 10 signals. The models used was Naive Bayes, Bagging, Random Forest, KNN, Support Vector Machine and Boosting. The project focused more on preprocessing and data selection/transformation.

<ProjectCard title="Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier" link="https://anantham.github.io/NaiveBayesKS/" bg="linear-gradient(to right, #D585FF 0%, #00FFEE 100%)">
I wrote my own code and took a presentation on how the naive bayes classifier works using the Iris flower data set. Basics of probability theory were also covered.
