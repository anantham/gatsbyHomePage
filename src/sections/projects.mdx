<ProjectCard title="Binary Classifier" link="https://github.com/anantham/Stats202" bg="linear-gradient(to right, #D4145A 0%, #FBB03B 100%)">
This project done in R, is part of my Stats202 class which I took when I went to Stanford university in the Summer of 2016. The objective was to determine if a query was relevant (yes/no) to a webpage given 10 signals. The models used was Naive Bayes, Bagging, Random Forest, KNN, Support Vector Machine and Boosting. The project focused more on preprocessing and data selection/transformation.

As part of my Computational Techniques in Control Engineering (IC 021) course taken by Dr. A. Ramakalyan, I made notebooks illustrating Catastrophic Cancellation, explaining LU decomposition and implemented the Gram-Schmidt method in python 2.

As part of my Image processing course (IC 040) taken by Dr. E. S. Gopi, I implemented Homomorphic filtering, tried downsampling and upsampling etc.

My code and ppt which I used when I took a class on how the naive bayes classifier works using the Iris flower data set. Basics of probability theory was also covered.
