## About me

> I can keep talking with you on topics that fascinate me; like science, philosophy and mathematics. I like sweets. A lot. I am open minded to the point of naivety. I have been working (unsuccessfully) on improving my handwriting for the past 8 years. You can message me and will find that I am an open book, ask any question without fear of offending me.
